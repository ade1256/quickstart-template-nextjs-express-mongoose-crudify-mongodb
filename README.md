* [body-parser] - Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.
* [dotenv] - Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.
* [express] - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.
* [glob] - Match files using the patterns the shell uses, like stars and stuff.
* [isomorphic-unfetch] - Switches between unfetch & node-fetch for client & server.
* [mongoose] - Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
* [mongoose-crudify] - Generates crud routes for mongoose model
* [next] - The react framework
* [react] - React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.
* [react-dom] - This package serves as the entry point to the DOM and server renderers for React. It is intended to be paired with the generic React package, which is shipped as react to npm.
